# Computational Science and Engineering

A repository dedicated to working through (18-085)[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-085-computational-science-and-engineering-i-fall-2008/], a course through MIT's Open CourseWare taught by Gilbert Strang from his book *Computational Science and Engineering*.

We will be using IPython Notebooks to work through this course. Instructions on setting up IPython Notebook on a Macintosh can be found (here)[https://joshuacook.github.io/blog/2014/12/20/ipython-clean-install/].
