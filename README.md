# Computational Science and Engineering

A repository dedicated to working through [18-085](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-085-computational-science-and-engineering-i-fall-2008/), a course through MIT's Open CourseWare taught by Gilbert Strang from his book *Computational Science and Engineering*.

We will be using IPython Notebooks to work through this course. Instructions on setting up IPython Notebook on a Macintosh can be found [here](https://joshuacook.github.io/blog/2014/12/20/ipython-clean-install/). 

We will be using Pandoc to render "final" pdfs of the work done here. Pandoc files will be written in a hybrid of markdown (for document formatting) and Latex (for math rendering) that mirror the presentation format of IPython Notebooks.

## IPython Notebook
The [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document. 

These notebooks are normal files that can be shared with colleagues, converted to other formats such as HTML or PDF, etc. You can share any publicly available notebook by using the [IPython Notebook Viewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) service which will render it as a static web page. This makes it easy to give your colleagues a document they can read immediately without having to install anything.

## Pandoc
If you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is your swiss-army knife. [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) can convert documents in markdown, reStructuredText, textile, HTML, DocBook, LaTeX, MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, OPML, Emacs Org-Mode, Txt2Tags, Microsoft Word docx, EPUB, or Haddock markup to

- HTML formats: XHTML, HTML5, and HTML slide shows using Slidy, reveal.js, Slideous, S5, or DZSlides.
- Word processor formats: Microsoft Word docx, OpenOffice/LibreOffice ODT, OpenDocument XML
- Ebooks: EPUB version 2 or 3, FictionBook2
- Documentation formats: DocBook, GNU TexInfo, Groff man pages, Haddock markup
- Page layout formats: InDesign ICML
- Outline formats: OPML
- TeX formats: LaTeX, ConTeXt, LaTeX Beamer slides
- PDF via LaTeX
- Lightweight markup formats: Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, MediaWiki markup, DokuWiki markup, Emacs Org-Mode, Textile
- Custom formats: custom writers can be written in lua.
