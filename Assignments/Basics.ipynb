      "At the molecular level, the movement of water is defined by quantum mechanics. The movement of each molecule in space-time is modeled by a single energy function, which represents the state of a molecules potential energy over time:\n",

      "In order to model the flow of water, this equation must be solved numerously and quickly. This partial differential equation is typically solved via the Eigenvalue method. The Eigenvalue method for solving linear systems is one of the most computationally expensive problems known and indeed much thought has been put into finding efficient numerical solutions that do not require the performance of an exorbitant number of calculations. The problem is typically solved by Iterative or Power Methods that involve multiplying the matrix $\\hat{H}$ by a random vector iteratively until the result converges on the largest eigenvector on $\\hat{H}$. The process is then repeated to find the next largest eigenvector and so on. \n",

      "Power methods already involve numerous numerical calculations. What may go unnoticed is that in the process of finding each vector, calculations are performed and then cast away as it is the final vector in the iteration that is sought. In other words, if $E_0\\approx\\hat{H}^{20}r_0$ for a sufficient degree of accuracy, then 19 matrix multiplications are essentially cast aside in the pursuit of this vector. For $\\hat{H}$ forming a basis in $\\mathcal{R}^3$, this is 9 multiplications and 6 additions per matrix multiplication or 135 operations that were performed once and must be performed again to find the next largest eigenvector. Imagine how many operations are performed for $\\hat{H}$ representing a mole of water i.e. forming a basis in $\\mathcal{R}^{N_A}$ where $N_A=6.023\\times10^{23}$!!!!\n",

      "Enter set theory. A linear subspace is a vector space that is a subset of some other higher dimension vector space. In the pursuit of more efficient algorithms for the solving of the eigenvector problem, computational mathematicians have turned to a particular linear subspace, the **Krylov Subspace** to streamline their solution. The order-$r$ Krylov Subspace generated by an $n\\times b$ matrix $A$ and a vector$\\mathbf{b}$ of dimension $n$ is the linear subspace spanned by the image of $b$ under the first $r-1$ powers of $A$ starting from $A^0=I$. Then \n",

      "\n",
      "When solving eigenvector problems, rather than performing matrix multiplication for each vector, the Krylov Subspace is formed once and saved in memory. Power methods are performed on the Krylov Subspace to find the largest vector. It is then orthogonalized to remove the aspects of the largest eigenvector from the subspace for the pursuit of the next largest eigenvector. Through the process of orthogonalization, then eigenvectors sought are gradually removed from the subset and thus from the ongoing calculations used in the solution. "
