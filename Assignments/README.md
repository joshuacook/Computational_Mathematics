# Computational Mathematics

This is intended to be a repository for some of the more outstanding projects I work on toward my degree in Applied Mathematics from Cal State Northridge. 

## Projects
An Exploration of Orthogonal Polynomials involving the Zernike Polynomials: [ipython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/joshuacook/computational_mathematics/blob/master/orthogonal_polynomials.ipynb)
